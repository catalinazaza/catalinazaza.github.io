# Challenging conventional wisdom {.smaller}

-   This article questions the mainstream view in globalization literature.

-   That dominant view is coherent but biased and premature.

-   It is too early to conclude that globalization has no negative impact on national public spending in OECD countries.

-   In fact, the association between increasing openness and public spending is negative over time.

# What if we wait a little longer? {.smaller}

-   The conventional wisdom may reflect a temporary phase of globalization.

-   Results may change as globalization deepens.

-   It's crucial to examine longer periods to assess its real impact (until 2004)

#  Competing Theories {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

* Efficiency Thesis (positive effects):
  + Globalization increases pressure on governments to reduce taxes to avoid capital flight.
  + Financial markets and firms penalize excessive public spending.
  + Results: short in public spending

:::{.column width="50%"}
* Compensation Thesis (negative effects):
  + Governments increase social spending to cushion the negative effects of globalization.
  + Expansion of the welfare state helps manage external risks and economic insecurity.
  + Results: increase in public spending

# Data and methodology {.smaller} 

-    Traditional approaches: Uses total public spending and public social expenditure as % of GDP.
-    Busemeyer's contribution: adds a residual category as **non-social spending** -
-    IV:Economic openness (measured via trade openness)
* Control variables:
   + Unemployment
   + Inflation
   + Time trends
   + Economic well-being
   + Female labor force participation
   + Maastricht effect (EU-related fiscal limitations)

# Results {.smaller}

![Busemeyer, 2004, p.18](C:/Users/catal/OneDrive/Escritorio/PL362/econ/images/table2.jpg){}

##  Interpretations {.smaller}

-   In 1980, each 1 percentage point increase in trade openness was associated with a 0.18-point increase in public spending (full model).

-   From the 1990s onward, this effect shrinks progressively.

-   By 2000, there is no statistically significant association between openness and public spending.

-   The model's RÂ² drops from 0.43 (1980) to 0.26 (2000).

-   Over time, the model loses much of its explanatory power.

# Conclusions {.smaller}

#

-   The positive effects of globalization on public and social spending have weakened over time.

-   In the 1980s and early 1990s, globalization may have contributed to welfare expansion.

-   But from the 2000s, the negative scenario becomes more prominent.

-   It's essential to study globalization across longer time periods, including the 2000s.

-   Pay attention to both cross-sectional and over-time dimensions.

# Question

-   Given that the positive relationship between globalization and social spending seems to weaken over time, can we still argue that economic openness strengthens the welfare state? Or is this a temporary compensation effect that fades as globalization deepens?
